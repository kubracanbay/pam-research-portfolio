# PAM Research Portfolio

This repository presents a structured collection of research, analysis and conceptual models related to **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**.  
It consolidates the academic works I co-authored, including studies on authentication, adaptive access control and SIEM integration, and extends them with practical, implementation-oriented notes.

The goal of this portfolio is to bridge the gap between **academic PAM research** and **real-world enterprise security implementations**.

## 📌 Included Areas of Research

### **1. PAM & Authentication**  
- Privileged identity validation  
- MFA workflows  
- Session initiation and monitoring  
- Risk considerations in administrative access  

### **2. Adaptive / Continuous Authentication in PAM**  
- Risk-based decision models  
- Behaviour-aware and context-aware authentication  
- Step-up authentication triggers  
- Session-level continuous evaluation  

### **3. PAM & SIEM Integration**  
- Event forwarding architectures  
- Correlation scenarios for privileged activity  
- Audit trail centralization  
- Detection of insider and external threats  

Each topic is organized under the `articles/` directory with extended notes and summaries.
