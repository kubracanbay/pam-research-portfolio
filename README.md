# PAM Research Portfolio

This repository presents a structured collection of research work focused on **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**, **phishing-resistant authentication**, **continuous adaptive authentication**, and **PAM–SIEM integration**.  
It includes summaries, conceptual overviews, and experimentally validated findings from three independent research papers.

## 📚 Included Research

### **1) Comparative Analysis of Advanced MFA Approaches in PAM**
A focused comparison of phishing-resistant and traditional MFA methods used in PAM systems.  
Topics include:
- FIDO2/WebAuthn  
- Biometric authenticators  
- Certificate-based smart cards  
- OTP-based MFA (SMS/Email/Push/Token)  
- Resistance to phishing, MitM, SIM-swapping, MFA fatigue  

---

### **2) Continuous Adaptive Authentication (CAA) Framework for PAM**
Experimentally validated design of a Continuous Adaptive Authentication model for privileged sessions, combining:
- Behavioral analytics  
- Device posture  
- Environmental context  
- Risk scoring  
- PAM + SIEM integration  
Includes quantitative findings from controlled testbed experiments (97% detection accuracy, <1s MTTR).  

---

### **3) The Role of SIEM–PAM Integration in Strengthening Cybersecurity**
Explores how forwarding PAM events into SIEM improves:
- Real-time detection  
- Contextual correlation  
- Insider threat identification  
- Automated incident response
