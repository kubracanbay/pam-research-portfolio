# PAM Research Portfolio

This repository presents a structured collection of research, analysis and conceptual models related to **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**.  
It consolidates the academic works I co-authored, including studies on authentication, adaptive access control and SIEM integration, and extends them with practical, implementation-oriented notes.

The goal of this portfolio is to bridge the gap between **academic PAM research** and **real-world enterprise security implementations**.
